- Go to a cafe, magically get anyone in the cafe's Facebook/Google/Twitter accounts

I see that a lot of these attacks rely on people's behavior, as opposed to any particular technical tricks

# Basic Rules of Thumb

- Use strong passwords + a password manager
- Don't download sketchy things
- Double-check domains
  - On websites + emails

That will protect you from the most common types of attacks:

- Phishing
- Credential Stuffing
